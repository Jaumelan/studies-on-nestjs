## Exercise using NestJs, Typeorm and SQLlite

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Because this is an exercise, the app uses sqllite and the Typeorm sinchronize is set true for development porpouse.
Many of the routes does not make sense in a real app, but those are there for practicing with Typeorm.
